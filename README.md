# Offset-Hoverballs
An unofficial update to Marum's hoverballs tool for gmod. Contains fixes and new features.

# How is this different from Marum's hoverballs?
Marum's hoverballs haven't been updated since September of 2016*, this version is up to date and actively being worked on.*
This version features several fixes and improvements over Marum's original version such as:
- Full duplicator support, no more broken hoverballs after duping a contraption.
- Parity with original gmod hoverball tool, entities spawn in the same way with the same offsets and angles as the OG tool.
- Hoverball entities can have their values updated without having to remove and re-add them.
- Added hotkeys to increase/decrease hover height, toggle hovering on and off, etc.
- Added an airbrake function to slow down without relying on thrusters.
- More that can be found on the Steam workshop page: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2502939629

*(At time of writing)

# How to install:
Drop the offset_hoverballs folder into your garrysmod/addons directory and you're done.

This addon wouldn't exist at all without Marum's original version.
