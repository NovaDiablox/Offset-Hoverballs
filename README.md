# Offset-Hoverballs
An unofficial update to Marum's hoverballs tool for gmod. Contains fixes and new features.

# How is this different from Marum's hoverballs?
Marum's hoverballs haven't been updated since September of 2016, this version is more up to date and (hopefully) less broken on modern gmod.
This version features several fixes and improvements over Marum's original version such as:
- Wiremod support, if wire is installed on your server or singleplayer game.
- Full duplicator/advdupe2 support, no more broken hoverballs after duping a contraption.
- Added hotkeys to smoothly increase/decrease hover height, toggle hovering on and off, etc.
- Added an airbrake function to slow down your vehicles without relying on thrusters.
- Experimental 'Slippery mode' allows your vehicles to slide down slopes. Make a hover-sled!
- Sleek-ish UI that shows info when looking at a hoverball.
- Can now click existing hoverballs to update their values without having to remove and replace them.
- Update settings on a whole contraption in one go with SHIFT + right click.
- Configuration options for everything you could want, and probably even some stuff you didn't.
- Lasers! Everybody loves lasers.

# How to install:
